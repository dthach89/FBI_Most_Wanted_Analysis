Dashboard Blueprint

The dashboard will be built using Tableau Public, Jupyter Notebook, Python, and Excel.

The dashboard visualization will include a chart for each year there was data collected, a chart to represent the totals by day of the week, a chart for the overall success, based on filter configuration, and several filter options including type of contact, housing loan status, personal loan status, credit default status, marital status, education level and job type. The filters are interactive and will update the charts appropriately.
